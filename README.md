<h1 align="center">RebelDupe Archived Skripts</h1>

These are the publicly-released scripts from RebelDupe! Feel free to use them for whatever you like, portions or 
entire scripts, for your server! Hopefully the dupe genre will stay alive and prosper after this release.

Thank you to the developers who created these scripts: **[Lynxdeer](#lynxdeer)**, **[Cheese](#cheese)**, **[Luke](#luke)**, and **[Cyber](#cyber)**     
           
Thank you to the RebelDupe community for supporting us and making the best possible few years (writing in Feb 2022) 
that we could ever ask for. This server has created memories for all and we thank every single one of you out there for it, no matter how big or small of an impact you had.          
Thank ->**YOU**<-

### IMPORTANT SKRIPT NOTE: Some of these scripts rely on certain locations, variables, people, etc. that will need to be adjusted for a server if any developers out there are going to use it for their purpose! These scripts also may have ran on an older version of Minecraft, Skript, and PaperSpigot; keep that in mind!
